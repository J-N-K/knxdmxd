You can use EIBD-IP connections with ip:&lt;IP-address&gt;.\r\n\r\n## -c &lt;filename&gt;\r\n\r\nPath and filename of configuration file. It is recommended to locate the knxdmxd.conf in /etc/knxdmxd.conf. If no option is given, the current directory is used (i.e. ./knxdmxd.conf).\r\n\r\n## -p &lt;filename&gt;\r\n\r\nPath and filename of PID file. It is recommended to locate the knxdmxd.pid in /var/run/knxdmxd.pid. If no option is given, the current directory is used (i.e. ./knxdmxd.pid).\r\n\r\n## -d\r\n\r\nRun as daemon\r\n\r\n# Configuration\r\n\r\nthe configuration file conforms to JSON-standard. Malformed configuration files may cause the knxdmxd to crash. Strings have to encapuslated with quotation marks.\r\n\r\n## channels\r\n\r\nChannels are the basic building block of the configuration. They consist of at least have a name and DMX-address.\r\n\r\n### &quot;name&quot; : &lt;string&gt;\r\n\r\nChannel names are not restricted in length or composition. They must be unique within the configuration. It is recommended not to use umlauts.\r\n\r\n### &quot;dmx&quot; : &lt;string&gt;\r\n\r\nThe DMX address has the notation &lt;universe&gt;.&lt;channel&gt;. According to standrad numbering, channel 0 and universe 0 do not exists. If the universe part is ommitted, universe 1 is assumed.\r\n\r\n### &quot;statusga&quot; : &lt;string&gt;\r\n\r\nIf defined, a telegram with the current channel value will be send via EIBD to the specified address whenever a crossfade finishes.\r\n\r\n### &quot;factor&quot; : &lt;float&lt;\r\n\r\nDefaults to 1.0. All values set within knxdmxd for this channel are multiplied with this value. Can be used to adjust colors in RGB setups or for brightness corrections in multi-unit setups.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
