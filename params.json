{"name":"knxdmxd","tagline":"A KNX (EIBD) to E1.31 daemon","body":"### What is knxdmxd?\r\n\r\nknxdmxd is a daemon that sends E1.31-data (DMX over Ethernet, similar to Artnet) and is controlled by KNX/EIB telegrams using eibd. So basically you need a device that understands E1.31 (e.g a \"bridge\" to standard DMX/E1.11) and a working eibd-setup.\r\n\r\n### Command line options\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Trademarks and similar\r\nKNX and EIB are trademarks of the KNX Asscoiation, Belgium.\r\nEIBD is part of the BCUSDK by M. KÃ¶gler\r\nE1.31 and DMX-512 are standards of PLASA North America\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
